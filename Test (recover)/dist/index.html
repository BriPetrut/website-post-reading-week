As almost anyone can post anything via various blogs, social media, or out With web 2.0, there is an increased risk of confusion on what is real and what sources may be deemed as reliable.</p1><br>
    <br>
    <p1>As a result, Web 2.0 brings about higher stakes regarding communication. It's more likely to have fake accounts, spammers, forgers, or hackers that attempt to steal information, imitate personas, or trick unsuspecting Web 2.0 users into following their agenda. As Web 2.0 doesn't always and can't verify information, there is a heightened risk for bad actors to take advantage of opportunities.</p1>
