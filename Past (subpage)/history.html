            <h3>The beginnings of the internet was a revolutionary moment without a doubt. However, it’s ealy design was not. Thankfully this was short lived as more users embraced the technology and disseminated their findings.</h3>
            <h3>Web 1.0 is the abbreviated term that ecnompases anything from the first generation of the Web. Otherwise known as the “Read Only Web” it started in the late 1980’s and ended in 2005.</h3>
            <h3>This era of the internet had very little interaction and it was passive in nature. Defined by static pages full of content, it allowed users to search for information and read it. Hence why it’s known as the “Read Only Web”.</h3>
            <h3>These pages where part of an intricate system of hypertext documents (webpages) written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). These pages could be accessed via the Internet with various web browsers.</h3>
            <h3>During this time there was a strong battle over the market-share these web browsers. This has come to be known as the first browser war. To learn more go back one page and proceed to the browser war section</h3>

            <h3>Did you know that the internet was created by the US defense department’s lavishly funded research arm, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa)?</h3>
            <h3>It was created as a network to allow communication in between government agencies and defence contractors.</h3>
            <h3>But, it wasn't until the invention of HTML that it took off in the hands of civilians across the world.</h3>
            <h3>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. It originally had 18 tags, compared to 140 tags today!</h3>
            <h3>Thanks to his system he was able to create the first website. Visit it here</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>It’s no surprise that Tim Burners-Lee called it the ‘Web of the people’. After all it was easily accessible and allowed for communities of people to bond over topics and love of sharing information.</h3>
